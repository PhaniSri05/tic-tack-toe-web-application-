# tic-tack-toe-web-application-

This project is a fully-featured Tic-Tac-Toe Web Application developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It offers both an engaging user interface and interactive gameplay experience, allowing users to play against another human or a basic AI opponent. The game consists of a responsive 3Ã—3 grid-based layout built with CSS Grid, and includes core functionality such as turn-based play, winner detection logic, and draw handling. The application supports advanced features like real-time score tracking (for Player X, Player O, and Draws), a visually appealing UI with winning combination highlighting, and a restart button to instantly reset the game. Additionally, users can toggle between light and dark themes with a dedicated Dark Mode button, improving the user experience and accessibility. A unique background image has also been integrated to enhance visual aesthetics, with all elements styled to maintain readability over the image. The layout is fully responsive, making it compatible with desktop and mobile devices. This project helped in strengthening my understanding of DOM manipulation, event handling, responsive design, and basic game logic in JavaScript. It serves as a strong foundation for further development, such as adding smarter AI using algorithms like Minimax, sound effects, or animations in future iterations.
